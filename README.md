#Expat Connection

####Intro
Expat Connection will be an app for expatriates (a person who lives outside of their native country) to connect with other expats in their area. This app is intended for users to publish posts in order to find other people from a common home city/country and/or current city and/or language(s) to find each other and form friendships and build a community. In these posts, users will be able to publish comments to interact with other users; users may also post events to meet up with other members.

####Technologies used:

####Approach
Three main models will be used to reach the MVP for this app: User, Post, and Comment. The main model will be posts, as it will be the main thing bringing users together. Users will have an optional field to fill in regarding event location/hours/theme in case they are planning to get together at a certain place for whatever purpose they wish. Users will be able to enter some facts about themselves a log with a bio in order for other users to learn about them. Comments will be enabled with a date & timestamp so that users are aware of how relevant/current they are.
